# Mantis

An easy to deploy observability platform based on the LGTM stack i.e. Loki, Grafana, Tempo and proMetheus. This is a personal project to help me monitor personal systems and applications but feel free to use it for your own needs.

## Features

- **Loki** for log aggregation and querying.
- **Grafana** for visualization and dashboarding.
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing.
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting.
- Pre-configured dashboards and alerts for quick setup.
- Docker Compose setup for easy deployment.
